The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the `snapshot.exists` property has been checked.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations.  For example, if you immediately try to access `snapshot.data().someProperty` without first checking if `snapshot.exists` is true, you will get an error because `snapshot.data()` will be undefined if the document doesn't exist.
